# Champion of the Arena

## What is "Champion of the Arena"?
Champion of the Arena is a game developed in Java where players create their own custom character
who will fight battle after battle in order to become champion of the arena. Players will be able
to choose their character's:

- Name
- Race (*Human, dwarf or elf*)
- Class (*Warrior, rouge or merchant*)

As an avid fan of video games and D&D, I chose to create a game that would implement features 
from D&D to create fun gameplay for anyone to enjoy. In between rounds of combat at the arena, players
are able to spend their hard-earned gold in various ways, like:

- Buying new equipment for their inventory
- Training to increase their stats
- Drinking potions to heal their health

Each time the player picks up the game, the experience will always be different due to how character
stats control the flow of combat. Fast characters always attack first, while strong characters will
do the most damage. Players have complete control over their play style, and how they make their fighter.

Do you have what it takes to become **champion of the arena**?
