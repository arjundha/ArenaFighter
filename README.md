# Fighting Tournament 

## What is "Fighting Tournament"?
Fighting Tournament is a game developed in Java which sees players create their own custom character
who will fight battle after battle in order to become champion of the tournament. Players will be able
to choose their character's:

- Name
- Race (Human, dwarf or elf)
- Class (Warrior, rouge or mage)

As an avid fan of video games and D&D, I chose to create a game that would implement features 
from D&D to create fun gameplay for anyone to enjoy.
