# Fighting Tournament 

## What is "Fighting Tournament"?
Fighting Tournament is a game developed in Java which sees players create their own custom character
who will fight battle after battle in order to become champion of the tournament. Players will be able
to choose their character's:

- Name
- Race (*Human, dwarf or elf*)
- Class (*Warrior, rouge or mage*)

As an avid fan of video games and D&D, I chose to create a game that would implement features 
from D&D to create fun gameplay for anyone to enjoy.

## User Stories
This project was developed in four phases, with each stage having their own user stories
being implemented. The stories implemented in each stage can be seen as follows:

### Phase 1 - Console Based Application
